Assignment 3

In our daily life, we need to have calculated data to make decisions. There are many areas that a simple calculator facilitates the computation
of values greatly. Examples of calculators are, geometric calculator, date and time calculator, age calculator, marriage calculator and
hundreds of other types. In this assignment we create an application with two calculators, Fuel Calculator, BodyMassIndex (BMI)
Calculator and Calorie-Calculator (BMR, VG part). You can then add more calculators to your application in the future (using TabControl
for more space).

With today's high fuel prices, the economy of driving a car affects the economy of the family considerably. There are certainly a lot of people
who don't know how to calculate the fuel consumption for their cars. It would therefore be helpful to have a Fuel Calculator program that
takes necessary input from the user and calculates some useful data. In addition most people should think of their weight and the calories
they take in daily to keep themselves healthy. Our BMI and BMR Calculators will help them control their weight.
